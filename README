Dependencies:
=============

Perl:    JSON JSON::Parse
         Install with:       cpan -i JSON JSON::Parse                 (use sudo for systemwide installation)


External programs: wget   
         If not available, you have to create the json data manually. Files must have specific names, see the TestData directory.


Usage:  
======

For InSpireMakePublist.pl and InSpireMakeCitationList.pl:

Preferences: You should edit the files and set your personal (or other person's) data appropriately.          Follow the instructions from the comments in the source files.
             The LaTeX output can be controlled from special variables in the beggining of the script files.  Follow the instructions from the comments in the source files.
        
Then, simply make the scripts InSpireMakePublist.pl, InSpireMakeCitationList.pl executables and run them in the command line, or run them as Perl scripts in any way you know.

For jsoncat: This is a fundamental tool to inspect the content of json files.

Usage: jsoncat [options] <files>
 -t: Show title
 -a: Show authors
 -d: Show doi
 -j: Show journal
 -T: Show type of publications: ARTICLE, INPROCEEDINGS etc
 -l: long   listing
 -L: longer listing
 -r: make report: multiple line output per record
 -A: make a report like -r, but print also the abstract
 -D: dump data up to level $dumpDepth (Default: 8)
 -B $dumpDepth: Set level $dumpDepth for a data dump.
Reads <files> or STDIN for JSON entries and print information in STDOUT. Each file (or STDIN) must contain only one JSON record.

Examples: 
jsoncat -r file1.json file2.json file3.json
cat file.json |  jsoncat -d | column -t
cat file.json |  jsoncat -a | cat -n               | column -t -s"|"
cat file.json |  jsoncat -l | grep article         | column -t -s"|"

Output:
=======

1. InSpireMakePublist.pl

   In the following filenames ${mylname} = <Your Last Name>

   a. publist-${mylname}.tex         A LaTex file which you can compile and create your publication list
   b. InSpire-${mylname}.json        The JSON data obtained from spires
   c. InSpire-${mylname}.bib         A BibTeX file with your publications, which you can use elsewhere
   d. InSpire-${mylname}.log         A logfile with human readable information. Useful for debugging.
   e. InSpire-${mylname}.pdat        A dump of the JSON data in human readable form up to a certain level (default: 8)
   f. InSpire-${mylname}.pdat.all    A full dump on the JSON data at all levels

Examples can be found in TestData/ for ${mylname} = Anagnostopoulos
Examples of the LaTeX source, and its compiled pdf can be found in Examples/publist-Anagnostopoulos.tex,  Examples/publist-Anagnostopoulos.pdf

2. InSpireMakeCitationList.pl

   a. citlist-${mylname}.tex         A LaTex file which you can compile and create your citation list
   b. files b, c, d, f, same as from  InSpireMakePublist.pl
   c. A JSON   file for the citation list of each of your pubications. The format is InSpireCiting-<arXiv no.>-<slac id>_<bitex entry>_.json   For example: InSpireCiting-9908054-506246_Ambjorn:1999mc_.json
   d. A BibTex file for the citation list of each of your pubications. The format is InSpireCiting-<arXiv no.>-<slac id>_<bitex entry>_.bib    For example: InSpireCiting-9908054-506246_Ambjorn:1999mc_.bib
   e. A log file in human readable form with the results: InSpireCiting-${mylname}.log

Files c+d are automatically fetched (once) using wget. If you don't have wget available, you should created them otherwise.

Examples of files a-e are in the TestData/ directory
Examples of citlist-${mylname}.tex, citlist-${mylname}.pdf are in the Examples/ directory.

Citations are separated in 3 categories:
   Type 0: citations
   Type 1: self-citations by collaborators, but not you
   Type 2: self-citations by you and others
